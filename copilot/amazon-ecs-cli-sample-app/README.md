The ECS CLI is a tool for developers to create, release and manage production ready containerized applications on ECS. From getting started, pushing to staging and releasing to production, the ECS CLI can help manage the entire lifecycle of your application development.

This is a small sample app that can be used to demonstrate the ECS CLI V2. It creates a static website using nginx as the frontend.
